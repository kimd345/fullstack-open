## Personal Notes
### Programming Paradigms
different ways to look at programming problems and organize code.
1. Procedural - declare functions and variables line-by-line, linear top-down execution.
2. Functional - pure functions, conditionals and recursion without mutating state and data.
3. Object Oriented - organize data and methods that operate on that data in objects. everything is represented by an object and manipulate state of objects using methods.

### Object Oriented Programming
1. Encapsulation - Private object groups (classes are popular) to separate data and data-specific methods into objects (closures, private fields, etc).
- 
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
